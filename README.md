# 🚀 GFG 160 DSA Challenge

Welcome to my DSA learning journey! ✨

I’ve taken up the GeeksforGeeks 160 DSA Sheet, but with a personal twist:

1. Instead of solving just 1 problem a day (as the sheet suggests), I’m pushing myself to solve multiple problems daily.

2. My goal is to complete the entire sheet in 2 months (max).

3. I’ll do this without relying on external help/tutorials — to build genuine problem-solving skills.

This repo will track my daily progress, solutions, and approaches. I’ll also include key learnings from each problem to make revision and reflection easier.

📌 Why this Challenge?

I’ve always been fairly good with logic building, but I realized I struggle a bit in translating that logic into clean, working code.

This challenge is my way of bridging that gap:

1. Building consistency in problem-solving.

2. Improving coding implementation skills.

3. Learning to handle time complexity & optimization better.

4. Developing the mindset to write code that not only works but also scales.

🛠 How I’m Approaching It

Solve 2–4 problems daily depending on difficulty.

Document my first working approaches ✅ (even if not the most optimal).

Revisit problems later to explore better solutions/alternative approaches.

Push code to GitHub daily 📂 (commit history will show progress & consistency).

Share reflections and problem breakdowns on LinkedIn alongside this repo.

🌱 Learning Goals

1. Strengthen DSA foundations (Arrays → Graphs → DP).

2. Get comfortable with handling time complexity & constraints.

3. Build coding discipline through daily practice & documentation.

4. Share my journey openly to learn, connect, and grow with others.
